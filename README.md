# Game BFFS

Create a web game platform that allows users to design and play online games with each other using the MEAN stack. Games could include first person shooters, turn-based strategy games, and classic boardgames.

Players could create their own custom avatar and use it in a variety of unique game worlds. In addition, they could connect to friends and join in multi-player tournaments using real-time chat and a leaderboard system.

The game platform would utilize an intuitive user interface so it's easy to pick up and use while utilizing the full capabilities of the MEAN stack. This would include role-based authentication, data storage (both user and game-related), and responsive web design to make sure the game works seamlessly on any device.
